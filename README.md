# News-App
A News Application using Android Studio

I created a News application using Spring, MongoDB, Postman, and Android Studio. This app divides the news into 3 categories, economics, sports, and politics. Users can comment on each news article and interact with other users. All Sabanci University students' comments can be seen in the comments section. These are gathered through several API's. More information regarding the project is in the PDF file provided.
